- Note:
(1) The code is based on our paper:
    Nonlocal Random Walks for Semi-Automatic 2D-to-3D Image Conversion, 
    accepted by IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, DOI:10.1109/LSP.2014.2359643
(2) The code has been tested in MATLAB R2013a running on Windows 7(64bit). 
(3) This code is not optimized which means it is not as fast as shown in the supplementary_document of this paper.
    
- Usage example:
(1) Put the code and datasets in the same directory.
(2) Run demoNRW to do semi-automatic 2D-to-3D conversion using our method.
